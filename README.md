## Welcome to my user page!

I enjoy diving into data to tell stories and make decisions. Here's a sample of past projects I've done:

- [Exploratory Analysis of Chocolate Bars](https://www.kaggle.com/wtbyte/exploratory-analysis-of-chocolate-bars): a quick look at chocolate bar ratings across the world.

- [FGO SSR Calculator](https://wtbyte.shinyapps.io/FGO_SSR_Summon_Calculator/): creating a simple interactive app using R Shiny. May take a few minutes to start the environment.

- [FGO Reddit Survey Analysis](https://wtbyte.github.io/Survey_Results_v3.html): cleaning and analysis of survey data using R.

- [FGO Servant Stats](https://wtbyte.github.io/fgo_servant_stats.html): visualisation of FGO servant hp and attack stats using plotly. Currently WIP.

- [Time Spent By Age](https://wtbyte.github.io/time_spent_by_age.html): alternative representation of time spent by age
